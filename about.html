        <p class = "intromain">I love pomegranates, which makes it rather frustrating when it doesn't appear in grocery markets almost year round. It only appears in the area during a certain season, leaving me pomegranate-deprived for the rest of the year. So, roughly a year ago, we planted a pomegranate tree in our backyard. I watered it constantly, more than any other plant in our garden, and made sure to see if there were any developments since the last time I saw it, whenever I was in the yard. I waited for months....until I started seeing tiny buds that looked a lot like this:</p>

        <p class = "intromain">In September of 2020, my mom plucked the first pomegranate of the tree and placed it for all to behold on the kitchen island. When I saw it I leaped for joy, despite knowing beforehand my mom was going to pluck it any day now. I was so excited, I honestly just wanted to look at the fruit rather than eat it. It was perfect in every way possible (or maybe that was my distorted vision). The shape; perfect, the color; not a spot of green. Just a beautiful rich red. I could only imagine the inside!! I decided I would keep the fruit for a few more days before peeling it. Two days flew by in a flash, and every time I was in the kitchen, or even on the same floor, I would glimpse at the gleaming surface of the pomegranate sitting there on a plate on the counter. When the day came, I carefully put the fruit on a cutting board and after cutting the top and bottom, cut four deep slits, careful not to cut into any seeds. After I'd split the fruit open I gazed at the array of seeds before me. Not one of them was brown or white, both of which signify an old or too ripe fruit, respectively. Now that the hard part was over, I peeled all the seeds out. Despite the urge to eat the ones I peeled right then and there, I issued much self-restraint and forced myself to keep peeling. When I finally had taken out every last seed, I put the peel in the compost and gazed at my half-box full of pomegranate seeds. A small part of me felt disappointed I didn't have much, but the rest of me was filled with joy. I cautiously took a seed and inspected it before popping it in my mouth. <b>Pure.</b> <b>Bliss.</b> After that nothing could stop me. I ate them one at a time, trying to conserve them, but it was a failing effort. I finished the box in just over two days. Thankfully two new ones were nearly ripe. After that taste of pomegranate after so long, the word "elated" took on a new meaning.</p>
